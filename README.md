# Assignment 1 - Embedded Systems

This assignment is a basic implementation of a State Machine in LabView.
The state machine is modeling a vending machine which allows 5, 10 and 25 cent
coins to be inserted. The cans cost 25 cents. Once 25 cents is exceeded,
the light representing the `dispense soda` action is lit, and the user gets
back any amount by which they exceed 25 cents in their purchase.
